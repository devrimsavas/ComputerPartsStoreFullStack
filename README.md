# Computer Parts Store Fullstack Project

This is a fullstack web application for browsing and managing computer parts, built with **Next.js** (frontend) and **Node.js** (backend).

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To start both the frontend and backend servers, run the following command in the root folder:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch both the frontend and backend simultaneously using the script defined in the root `package.json`.
