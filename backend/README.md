## Data Reset Notice

- When the app starts or when `Refresh` is clicked, data is **re-fetched** from the API:
  ```
  http://backend.restapi.co.za/items/cparts
  ```
- This **overwrites the in-memory parts object** â€” locally added parts will be lost unless manually preserved.
- This behavior is expected for the assignment and mimics a reset on each refresh.

---

## Button Visibility Based on Login

- The **"Add Item"** and **"Edit"** buttons are only visible when a user is logged in
- Guest users will see a **disabled edit button** or no access to protected pages
- The navbar also reflects login state:
  - Shows **Sign In** for guests
  - Shows **Log out** and username if authenticated
